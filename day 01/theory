variables - variables are used to store data in them which can be accessed when the user wants
  name = "shadow" 
here name is the variable which contains value "shadow" in it.
things to keep in mind when creating variables:
 - variables should not have spaces in them
 - variable names should not be the same as any inbuilt function(just to avoid confusion)
 - always name variables which can referred and understood easily
 - it cannot start with a number
 - abc,Abc,ABC,aBc,aBC are all different variables
 - variable can contain only a-z,0-9 and _
