there are mainly 4 types of data types in python:
1. strings  : these are collection of alphabets,characters or words, and it enclosed using " " or ' ' quotes
    name = "python"
  in python numbering starts from 0 and data can be accessed using its indexes
 
2.integer: when we have whole numbers it is called as integers
     count = 10

3.float: when we have decimal numbers it is called as float
    num = 10.90

4.Boolean :  it is either True or False

type error:  when  we combine different variables we get this error
type casting : converting a variable of one type into another data type is called as typecasting
type() - can be used to know the data type of a variable

mathematical operations are  : + , -, * , /,** ,PEMDASLR,//

round()- is used when we want to round a number or we do not want decimal values
we can use +=, -=, *= , /= as a shortform when working with numbers

f-string : when we try to print different data types together we have to first convert it,at that time we can use f-strings

    print(f"example {} {} {} ")
